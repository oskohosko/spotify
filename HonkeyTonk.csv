Just across the border and into the city

Finally see what it means to be living

See, my old man's got a problem
He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his

She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him

Always, When you least expect it

Greet the girl of my dreams with a kiss on the hand ""what up?""
Little magnificant missing a man
Ran away, Like kids to a van (shut)

So gorgeous, Walking on water
Sort of like Erin McNaught, but little shorter
Wore a pandora, Bought her a charm
Wasn't short of thought with bit of Paul on her arm

Calling for calm, we fought, Made Iraq
And the border of Jordan a walk in the park
Jaws of a shark, Too hard to break it off
Fall apart, So I would say;

Rapunzel, Gotta let your hair down

I'm tired of fighting, We ain't going nowhere now
Gotta let your hair down

Why we trying? We ain't going nowhere now

Foolishly laying our hearts on the table, stumblin' in

You know these reckless thoughts of mine are following you
I'm falling for you, whatever you do

Whatever it takes, baby, I'll do it for you

Focused on what you feel
Just when you were calling her love that day

Laying in the bed with blood shot eyes
Late in the evening when the sun sinks low
That's about time my rooster crows

I've got women up and down this creek
Way to keep me going and my engine clean
Run me ragged, but I don't fret
'Cause there ain't been one slow me down just yet

Get me drinking that moonshine
Get me higher than a grocery bill
Take my troubles to the high wall
Throw them in the river and get your fill

We've been sniffing that cocaine
Ain't nothing better when the wind cuts cold
Lord, it's a mighty hard living
But a damn good feeling to run these roads

I pray the stars will shoot her all the wishes she can hold
On the day that I return, I aim to lay her down
