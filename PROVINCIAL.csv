What would you go do with me?
Could I give you what they gave you, gave to you?

Because I came to find you
This doesn't mean I wouldn't lie to you
And this couldn't mean I'm good enough for you
Because I came to find you
This doesn't mean I wouldn't lie to you
And would you drink yourself loose?

Both hands on my face
Kiss me like you're lonely
I left you dead and saying, ""If only""
Both hands on my face

But it's hard when the truth is such a shame
I never wanted to say, ""I'm sorry""
But ""sorry"" is all I can say

Is it really all that bad when I dream?
Yeah, I dream about you
You know that a lot of the things you say
About me, were never true

I've lost a few good friends lately
And I think it's my fault, not theirs
I was never a fake or phoney
I just needed a change, I guess

Why does it feel so good
To be self-destructing again?
