Gone a little far this time with something
How was I to know
How was I to know this high came rushing

We're on the borderline
Dangerously fine and unforgiving
Possibly a sign
I'm gonna have the strangest night on Sunday

Here I go
Quite a show for a loner in LA
I wonder how I managed to end up in this place
Where I couldn't get away

We're on the borderline
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture

Then I saw the time
Watched it speedin' by like a train
Like a train

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up

Look me in the eyes first

Showed you every single scar
Say it's you, not me
'Cause that's my favorite part

Why, does it hurt so much?
With every single touch we thought this was love
Why, do I wanna stay numb
I want to be alone, I just don't know how
Why, does it hurt so much

Pull up and stall, I keep my beer in the cellar

Feeling all different kinds of things
We were talking about everything
From the past to the happening
We started talkin' 'bout devotion
The kind that goes on eternally
And I tell her I'm in love with her
But, how can I know that I'll always be?

She just said is it true? Is it true? Tell me now
Thats a promise I can't make and I won't validate

Splashes of ashes
Embers arising
Smoke fills the skies in

Wind blows in then crashes
Waves over the ashes
Hills washed up in violet
Eyes close up to hide it

What's That Line?

Is it really all that bad when I dream?
Yeah, I dream about you
You know that a lot of the things you say
About me, were never true

I've lost a few good friends lately
And I think it's my fault, not theirs
I was never a fake or phoney
I just needed a change, I guess

Why does it feel so good
To be self-destructing again?
