Sleeping till a quarter past three, still sideways
Driving downtown in a white-tee

Livin' in your mystery
There's something there to say
And now I can take hold of the future
And no one else will pay
You're always when I need you, there
To hear what I say

Take it away
Somewhere to go
Lead me astray
Where nobody knows, hey

You hear me yellin' out, runnin' out
Runnin' out of ideas

That's when I saw her, Ooh, I saw her

And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
